# Controlling the Position of Elements

CSS has the following position schemes that allows you to control the layout of your page.

- **Normal Flow**
    Since this is the default way you don't need to add into CSS
- **Relative Position**
    ```css
    position: relative;
    ```
- **Absolute Positioning**
    ```css
    position: absolute;
    ```
- **Fixed Positioning**
    ```css
    position: fixed;
    ```
- **Floating Elements**
    ```css
    float: right;
    ```
