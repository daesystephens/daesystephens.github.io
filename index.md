### Growth Mindset 
I'm going to explain to you what **growth mindset** is all about. If you would like more information there is an awesome article [How you can benefit from a growth mindset](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/growth-mindset).

Growth Mindset is the ability to develop through hard work, good strategy, and the feedback from others to be able to improve to be a better version of yourself. Having able to have a growth mindset helps you to achieve more compared to those with a fixed mindset. People with growth mindset focus more into learning and see obstacles as a learning experience. 

### 3 Remainders of How to Keep Myself in a Growth Mindset

1. Effort: instant gratification monkey – but I also know the feeling won’t last and I’ll feel guilty later, as always. The trite-but-true phrase “no pain, no gain” is pure growth mindset! I feel better. It’s hard work, sure, and the good feeling isn’t instantaneous (though sometimes it is). But when the ride is over and my body feels better, my spirit is stronger. I’m proud of myself, and that goes a long, long way.

2. Criticism: And it turns out, variations of these questions help me process criticism from coworkers. Assuming their critique is valid (and it usually is), I can hold a mini-retrospective with myself:
  - Which aspects of my work am I most proud of?
  - What can I do to improve the aspects I’m less proud of?
That’s the dark side of growth, I guess…

3. Challenges: When I’m faced with a challenging coding problem, I have a tendency to work over one particular aspect of it again and again until I conclude that it’s impossible or that I’m incapable of solving it. I throw my hands up in surrender and stop. In other words, I’m in a fixed mindset and avoiding the problem by giving up.
So, lately, I try to recognize that avoidance, take a step back, and think about the growth mindset. When I’m ready, I walk  through the problem once again, bit by bit, looking for new ways to think about it until I start to see another way forward. And for me, it always helps to talk through these steps – out loud, not just in my head. I jot down clues as they come about. Soon enough (and rather miraculously), I begin to find root causes of the problem.
