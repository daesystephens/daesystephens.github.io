### Growth Mindset 
I'm going to explain to you what **growth mindset** is all about. If you would like more information there is an awesome article [How you can benefit from a growth mindset](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/growth-mindset).

Growth Mindset is the ability to develop through hard work, good strategy, and feedback from others to be able to improve to be a better version of yourself. Having able to have a growth mindset helps you to achieve more compared to those with a fixed mindset. People with a growth mindset focus more on learning and see obstacles as a learning experience. 

### 3 Remainders of How to Keep Myself in a Growth Mindset

1. **Effort**: instant gratification monkey – but also remember that the feeling won’t last and you'll feel guilty later, as always. The trite-but-true phrase **_“no pain, no gain”_**  is a pure growth mindset!. It’s hard work, sure, and the good feeling isn’t instantaneous (though sometimes it is). But when the ride is over you'll feel better. I'll feel proud of yourself, and that goes a long, long way.

2. **Criticism**: Variations of these questions will help you process criticism from coworkers. Assuming their critique is valid (and it usually is), You can hold a mini-retrospective with yourself:
    - Which aspects of my work am I most proud of?
    - What can I do to improve the aspects I’m less proud of?
  
    Remember criticism is about your performance only, and it is your job to use it to make improvements. 

3. **Challenges**: When faced with a challenging coding problem, I tend to work over one particular aspect of it again and again until I conclude that it’s impossible or that I’m incapable of solving it. I throw my hands up in surrender and stop. In other words, I’m in a fixed mindset and avoiding the problem by giving up.
So, Try to recognize that avoidance, take a step back, and think about the growth mindset. When ready, walk through the problem once again, bit by bit, looking for new ways to think about it until you start to see another way forward. Also, it always helps to talk through these steps – out loud, not just in your head. Jot down clues as they come about. Soon enough (and rather miraculously), You'll begin to find root causes of the problem.
