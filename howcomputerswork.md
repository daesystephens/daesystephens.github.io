# How Computers Work

All computers follow 4 main tasks:
1. Take input
2. Store information
3. Processing information
4. Output results

**Computers started as basic calculators only manipulating numbers. Modern computers can do more, but they still follow the main 4 tasks.**

**Input:** what you type on a keyboard, a touchscreen sensing a finger. All the inputs give the computer information which is then stored in **Memory (storage)**.

**Processor:** takes information from memory and manipulates it or changes it using algorithm. Then it sends it back to be stored in memory again. This continuous until the processed information is ready to be output.

**Output** computer's output information depends on what the computer is designated to do. A computer can display text, photos, videos or games.

*When computers connect to each other over the internet the output of one computer becomes the input to another one and vice-versa*

# Binary Data

Computers work on ones & zeroes. Inside a computer are electric wires and circuits that carry all the information. A signal wire can either ON or OFF, it can represent Yes or No, True or False, or 1 & 0's.

A single wire is called a **BIT**. The more **bits** the more complex information the computer can take.

Each operation done by a computer is so simple it could be done by a human, but the circuits inside a computer are way faster

**Why smaller computers also faster?**<br />
The smaller the circuit is, the less distance the electrical signal has to go. Which means the processing is faster and given us an immediate output.

**Everything we can do with technology requires lots of information to be processed extremely quickly. Underneath all this complexity is just lots of tiny little circuits that turn binary signals into websites, videos, music, games, etc.**

# Hardware and Software

**Hardware:** is what its inside a computer.
- circuit
- chips
- wires
- speaker
- plugs
- stuff

**Software:** is the part that you don't see. Software is all the computer programs or code running on a machine.

**How Hardware and Software interact with one another?**<br />
The software tells the CPU what to do and the CPU receives the commands that tell it which circuit to use to do a specific job.
The CPU has circuits to do simple math and logic. It also has other circuits to send and receive information to and from different parts of the computer.

# Operating System

An operating system, or "OS," is software that communicates with the hardware and allows other programs to run. It is comprised of system software, or the fundamental files your computer needs to boot up and function. Every desktop computer, tablet, and smartphone includes an operating system that provides basic functionality for the device.
