# How Computers Work

All computers follow 4 main tasks:
- Take input
- Store information
- Processing information
- Output results

**Computers started out as basic calculators only manipulating numbers. Modern computers can do more, but they still follow the main 4 tasks.**

**Input:** what you type on a keyboard, touchscreen sensing a finger. All the inputs give the computer information which is then stored in **Memory**.

**Processor:** takes inforamtion from memory and manipulates it or change it using algorithm. Then it sends it back to be stored in memory again. This continous until the processed information is ready to be output.

**Output** computer's output information depends on what the computer is designated to do. A computer can display text, photos, videos or games.
