# How Computers Work

All computers follow 4 main tasks:
1. Take input
2. Store information
3. Processing information
4. Output results

**Computers started out as basic calculators only manipulating numbers. Modern computers can do more, but they still follow the main 4 tasks.**

**Input:** what you type on a keyboard, a touchscreen sensing a finger. All the inputs give the computer information which is then stored in **Memory (storage)**.

**Processor:** takes information from memory and manipulates it or changes it using algorithm. Then it sends it back to be stored in memory again. This continous until the processed information is ready to be output.

**Output** computer's output information depends on what the computer is designated to do. A computer can display text, photos, videos or games.

*When computers connect to eache other over the internet the output of one computer becomes the input to another one and viceversa*

# Binary Data

Computers work on ones & zeroes. Inside a computer are electric wires and circuits that carry all the information. A signal wire can either ON or OFF, it can represent Yes or No, True or False, or 1 or 0.

A single wire is called a **BIT**. The more **bits** the more complex information the computer can take.
