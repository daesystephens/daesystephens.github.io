# Structure Web Pages with HTML

Process and Design of a Web
===========================
## Target your Audience
- Individuals
- Companies

Your content and design should be influenced by the goals of your users. You need to know why people are coming to your website.
You need to know their **motivations & goals**

When creating a website you need to have a list of reasons why people would be coming to your site.

## What Information Your Visitors Need

You need to work out what information they need in order to achieve their goals **quickly & effectively**. If the information doesn't appear relevant, they are likely to go elsewhere.

## How Often People Will Visit Your Site

Working out how often people are likely to revisit your site gives you an indication for how often you should update the site.
It can often be helpful to set a schedule for when a site will be updated.

## Site Maps

A **Site** Map is a diagram of the pages that will be used to structure your site. This will show how pages can be grouped.<br />

## Wireframes
Is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.
You should **not include the color scheme, font choices, backgrounds or images for the website** in the wireframe. It should focus on what information needs to be on each page and create a visual hierarchy.

## Getting Your Message Across Using Design
** Prioritize and Organize.**
- **Prioritizing:** By making parts of the page look distinct from surrounding content, designers draw attention to (or away from) those items.
- **Organizing:** Grouping together related content into blocks. You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.

## Visual Hierarchy
Most web users do not read entire pages. Rather, they skim to find information.
**Images** create a high visual contrast and often **attract the eye first**.
