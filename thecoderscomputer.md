# The Coder’s Computer

## What is a Text Editor?
It is a software that allows programmers to write and manage text. This text is usually used to write code to create Web Applications, HTML, and CSS. This is the place where you write your code.

## Choosing a Text Editor
There is a quite variety of text editors. How to choose the right one? In reality, even though some text editors have different features. Choosing the right text editor is more based on a personal choice on which one you can feel more comfortable to work with. 

__**Some features to look into are:**__
+Code completion
+Syntax Highlighting
+Easy to use and navigate
+Find and replace text
+Customizable appearance 

Usually your computer comes with a text editor, but unfortunately, these don’t have as many features as the other ones. That is why people tend to choose **other popular text editors**.

## Other Popular Text Editors
These text editors can be downloaded from their respective websites. Some required to pay a fee and some are free: 

**Notepad+ +:** is a free text editor for Windows Computers only.
**BB Edit:** Edit is a software that you purchase. But BB Edit comes with a 30- day free trial.
**Visual Studio Code:** Visual Studio Code is a free text editor made by the folks at Microsoft. It is available for Windows computers, Mac computers, and Linux computers.
**Atom:** Atom is a free text editor that’s available for download for Windows computers, Mac computers, and Linux computers. Atom is brought to you by the folks at GitHub.
**Brackets:** Brackets is a free text editor that’s available for download for Windows computers, Mac computers, and Linux computers. It’s made and maintained by the good folks at Adobe. 
**Sublime Text:** Sublime Text 3 is a premium software that can be purchased in full for $70. Otherwise, you’ll use the free version that runs indefinitely. **__This one so far is my favorite__**. 

## What is Command-Line?
Well, the command line (also known as a terminal) is a text interface for your computer. It’s a program that takes in commands, which it passes on to the computer’s operating system to run.
From the command line, you can navigate through files and folders on your computer, just as you would with Windows Explorer on Windows or Finder on Mac OS. The difference is that the command line is fully text-based.
